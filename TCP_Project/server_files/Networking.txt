Computer networking is the practice of connecting two or more computing devices to exchange data and share resources through wired or wireless links.
 It relies on communication protocols, which are sets of rules that govern data transmission. 
 Key components include devices like switches, routers, and access points, which facilitate connectivity and data flow, 
 making everything from email and online gaming to cloud storage possible.
